-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=quoti039m-combat-readyquot--rwby--pinterest--pennies>"I'm Combat Ready!" | RWBY | Pinterest | Pennies<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#quoti039m-combat-readyquot--rwby--pinterest--pennies>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/600x315/4e/3e/f9/4e3ef97bbf3d84792c45c047b3b059ab.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Mnt4dvGz3_nu6H3K4wMRjwHaD4&pid=15.1"' alt='"I&#39;m combat ready!" | RWBY | Pinterest | Pennies'><p><em>Source: pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>rwby.</p></blockquote><p>The History of Anime: From Manga to Animation
